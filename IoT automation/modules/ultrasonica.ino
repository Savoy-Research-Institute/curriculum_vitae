/*An ultrasonic sensor is a device that uses sound waves to measure distance.
How does an ultrasonic sensor work?
Sound waves we can't hear: The sensor sends out sound waves, but these are special sound waves called ultrasonic waves, 
which are so high-pitched that humans can't hear themâ€”kind of like a whistle that only some animals can hear!

Bouncing off objects: When these sound waves hit something, like a wall or a toy, they bounce back to the sensor, just like an echo.

Measuring distance: The sensor then measures how long it takes for the sound waves to come back. The longer it takes, the farther away the object is. 
If the sound comes back quickly, the object is close!
