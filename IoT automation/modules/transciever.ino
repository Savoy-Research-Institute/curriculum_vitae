/*A transceiver is a device that can both transmit and receive signals, like a walkie-talkie or your phone!
How does a transceiver work?
Sending signals (transmitting): A transceiver can send information, like sound, text, or data, over long distances using radio waves. 
It changes this information into a special kind of signal that can travel through the air.

Receiving signals: At the same time, it can also receive signals from another transceiver. When it gets the signal, 
it turns it back into useful information—like hearing your friend’s voice on a walkie-talkie or seeing a message on your phone.

Two-way communication: The special thing about a transceiver is that it can send and receive signals at the same time! 
That’s how you can talk and listen on a phone or how cars, drones, and robots communicate with controllers.

Why is it cool?
Transceivers are like messengers that work in both directions! They make it possible to send and receive messages, play online games, control robots, and even guide airplanes. 
Without transceivers, we wouldn't be able to communicate so easily across long distances.
