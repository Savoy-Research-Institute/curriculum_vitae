/*A barometer is a sensor that measures air pressure.
Think of air like water:
Just like when you're swimming underwater and you can feel the water pushing on you, air also pushes on everything around us, 
even though we don't see it. That push is called air pressure.
How does a barometer work?
Sensing air pressure: A barometer has a part inside that is sensitive to how hard the air is pushing on it. When the air pushes harder (higher pressure), 
the sensor feels it and gives a reading. When the air pushes less (lower pressure), the sensor knows that too.

Changes with height: Air pressure changes depending on how high you are. The higher you go, like up a mountain or in an airplane, the less air is above you, 
so the pressure is lower. The barometer senses this drop in pressure.

Predicting weather: Barometers can also help predict weather changes! If the air pressure drops, it usually means a storm is coming. If the pressure goes up, 
the weather is likely to be clear and sunny.
A barometer is like a "height detector" or "weather predictor." It helps drones fly at the right altitude and also gives us clues about what kind of weather to expect. 
Knowing the air pressure is super useful for both flying and forecasting!
