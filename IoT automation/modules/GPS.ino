/*A GPS (Global Positioning System) is a technology that tells you exactly where you are on Earth by using signals from satellites in space!
How does GPS work?
Satellites in space: There are special satellites way up in space that constantly send signals down to Earth. 
Imagine these satellites like “stars” in the sky that can communicate with GPS devices on the ground.

Catching the signals: A GPS device, like the one in a smartphone or a car, listens for signals from at least four satellites at a time. 
It can tell how far away each satellite is by how long the signals take to reach the device.

Finding your location: By comparing these distances, the GPS device can figure out exactly where you are. 
It's like having several friends in different places who tell you how far away they are from you, and then you figure out your exact location by comparing those distances.
Why is it cool?
GPS helps us find our way, no matter where we are! It’s like having an invisible map that tells you your exact spot on Earth. Without GPS, many modern conveniences like map apps, 
delivery services, or even finding your way back home could be a lot harder!
