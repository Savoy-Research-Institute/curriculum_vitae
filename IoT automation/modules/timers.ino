/*A timer is a tool in electronics and programming that helps measure time or perform tasks after a certain amount of time has passed. 
It’s like an alarm clock for your code or circuits!
How does a timer work?
Counting time: A timer keeps track of how much time has passed, just like a stopwatch. You can set it to wait for a specific amount of time and then do something, like turn on a light or play a sound.

Triggering actions: When the timer reaches the time you set, it triggers an action. For example, in a robot, you could use a timer to make it move forward for 5 seconds and then stop.

Repeating tasks: Timers can also repeat actions over and over. For example, you could make a robot beep every 3 seconds using a timer.
Why is it cool?
Timers help control the flow of time in electronics and software, allowing robots, games, and machines to behave in an organized way. 
They make sure everything happens at the right moment! Whether it’s making sure your robot turns off after 10 seconds or creating a countdown in a game, 
timers are super important to how things work.
