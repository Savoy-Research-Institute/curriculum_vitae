/*An accelerometer is a sensor that measures acceleration, which is the rate of change in velocity. 
It can tell how fast something is speeding up or slowing down, and in which direction.
Imagine you're in a car.

When the car speeds up quickly, you feel like you're being pushed back into your seat.
When the car slows down, it feels like you're being pushed forward.
And when the car turns, you feel like you're being pulled to the side.
That's because your body is experiencing acceleration — the car is changing speed or direction.

An accelerometer works in a similar way to figure out how much something is speeding up, slowing down, or moving side to side.

How does it work?
Inside the accelerometer, there are tiny parts that can move when the device they're in moves. Here's the fun part:

Tiny weights: Inside the accelerometer are very small, movable weights that shift around when you move the sensor. Think of them like little balls that roll around inside.
Springs or supports: These tiny weights are held in place by special springs or supports. When the device moves, 
the weights push or pull on these springs, just like how you might pull on a rubber band when you stretch it.

Measuring motion:
When you tilt or move the accelerometer, the tiny weights inside shift and push against the springs. This push is used to measure how much and in which direction the sensor is moving.
If you're holding a phone with an accelerometer, and you move the phone left or right, 
the accelerometer will sense that movement and tell the phone to change the screen direction or play a game in a new way.

/*A gyroscope is a sensor that helps figure out which way something is turning or rotating.
Imagine spinning a top:
When you spin a top, it stays upright as long as it’s spinning fast, but once it slows down, it wobbles and falls over. The top stays balanced while it’s spinning because of something called rotation stability.
A gyroscope works on a similar principle: it can sense when something is rotating or tilting and in which direction, helping to keep things balanced.

How does it work?
Inside a gyroscope, there are small parts that can spin or move when the device is rotating. Here’s how it works:

Spinning parts or tiny disks: Inside the gyroscope, there’s something that spins really fast. It could be a small disk or a wheel. The spinning creates stability, like how a top stays balanced when spinning.

Sensors to detect movement: As the object (like a drone, phone, or robot) moves or tilts, the gyroscope senses the change in direction or rotation. It feels if the device is turning to the left, right, up, or down.

No matter how you tilt it, the spinning part tries to stay in the same direction. By detecting this, the gyroscope can measure which way the object is turning.
